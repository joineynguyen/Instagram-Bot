1) Completed auto-liking feature
2) Found out Instagram limits the amount of likes performed per day and can detect if a bot is being used by how fast the liking occurs.
  A) Not sure how fast the bot able to like posts but re-designed code to like posts with delay of 1 second between posts to counter this limit.
  B) Sources say Instagram limits 300-400 likes per day, so the bot is redesigned to also stop after liking 300 posts.

  C) Added a boolean function "morePostsToLike" that returns true if there are more like buttons (elements that contains "Like" as text).
    I) This boolean function paired with a like counter for our while loop keeps the bot liking posts until there are no more unliked posts or the limit has been reached.

1) Auto-like feature was also liking the post's comments. The comment's 'like' button also has an "aria-label = 'Like'" attribute. To counter and specify the like button we want, another attribute "height='24'" was added to AND to in the WebElement currentLikeButton under likeAllPOstsInFeed function.
2) Decided to work on a feature for the bot to only like pictures from the current day to lower suspicion of bot behavior. (Ex. The bost likes all posts on feed including posts from weeks back)
