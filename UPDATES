-Completed auto-liking feature
-Found out Instagram limits the amount of likes performed per day and can detect if a bot is being used by how fast the liking occurs.
  -Not sure how fast the bot able to like posts but re-designed code to like posts with delay of 5 seconds between posts to counter this limit.
  -Sources say Instagram limits 300-400 likes per day, so the bot is redesigned to also stop after liking 300 posts.
