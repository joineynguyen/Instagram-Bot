-Completed auto-liking feature
1) Found out Instagram limits the amount of likes performed per day and can detect if a bot is being used by how fast the liking occurs.
  A) Not sure how fast the bot able to like posts but re-designed code to like posts with delay of 1 second between posts to counter this limit.
  B) Sources say Instagram limits 300-400 likes per day, so the bot is redesigned to also stop after liking 300 posts.
    I) https://socialpros.co/instagram-daily-limits#Instagram_Like_limits_in_2020
  C) Added a boolean function "morePostsToLike" that returns true if there are more like buttons (elements that contains "Like" as text).
    I) This boolean function paired with a like counter for our while loop keeps the bot liking posts until there are no more unliked posts or the limit has been reached.
