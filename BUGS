1) For the function, likePostsOnFeedFromToday(), the function will stop as soon as it  the first post on feed is at least 1 day old. This means that any post after, even if less than a day old will not be liked. This usually happens when the account follows a new account which will then add their posts to your feed, skewing up the chronological order.

2) The function, likePOstsOnFeedFromToday(), will not start if the first couple of posts are already liked.

3) For the watchStories() function: after watching all stories, the bot will continue clicking the next button after leaving the stories window. The bot will continue to click next button on posts with multiple pics/vids. The bot will soon stop and return to the top of the page. No damage will be done, don't be shocked.
